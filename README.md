# AI-Powered Image Restoration System

## Project Overview
This project explores state-of-the-art AI models for enhancing and restoring degraded images. I'm implementing and comparing three deep learning approaches (Real-ESRGAN, SwinIR, and BSRGAN) to address various image quality issues while developing a user-friendly interface and systematic evaluation framework.

## Problem Statement
Image degradation is a common challenge across photography, digital archives, and media. Issues include:
- Low resolution and loss of detail
- Noise and visual artifacts
- Blur and lack of sharpness
- Compression artifacts
- Color degradation

Traditional methods often struggle with these complex issues, especially when multiple degradation types co-exist in a single image. This project leverages recent advancements in AI to overcome these limitations.

## Data Information
The project uses:
- **RealSRSet** - A benchmark dataset proposed in the BSRGAN paper (ICCV 2021) containing real-world low-quality images
- **Custom test dataset** - I'm creating a structured collection of test images across several categories:
  - Portrait/facial images
  - Landscape and nature scenes
  - Urban/architectural photographs
  - Text documents
  - Images with fine textures and details
  - Low-light photography
  - Images with compression artifacts

This diverse dataset will enable systematic evaluation of each model's performance across different image types and degradation scenarios.

## Project Goals

### 1. Implementation of AI Models
- Set up Real-ESRGAN, SwinIR, and BSRGAN in a Google Colab environment
- Create a user-friendly interface for easy access to these powerful models
- Ensure efficient processing with options for memory management

### 2. Systematic Evaluation Framework
- Develop quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) for objective comparison
- Create a structured testing methodology across different image categories
- Identify specific strengths and weaknesses of each model

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- Design an intuitive interface with clear explanations
- Implement interactive model selection and parameter adjustment
- Create visualization tools for detailed result comparison
- Add export functionality for processed images

### 4. Documentation and Analysis
- Provide comprehensive documentation on model architectures and capabilities
- Analyze performance patterns across different image types
- Create visual representations of comparative results

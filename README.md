# Advanced Image Processing with AI: From Restoration to Generation

## Project Overview
This project explores state-of-the-art AI approaches for image processing, with a focus on image quality restoration and enhancement. While our initial concept involved diffusion models, thorough research led me to implement three powerful models (Real-ESRGAN, SwinIR, and BSRGAN) for this project due to their specific advantages for image restoration tasks. Future work may incorporate diffusion models for additional capabilities.

## Project Evolution
Our project began with an interest in diffusion models for image processing. However, during the research phase, we discovered that for specific restoration tasks, models like Real-ESRGAN, SwinIR, and BSRGAN currently offer several advantages:

1. **Specialized architecture** - These models were specifically designed for restoration tasks, with optimizations for different degradation types
2. **Computational efficiency** - They require less computational resources than full diffusion models while still delivering impressive results
3. **Practical usability** - They offer pre-trained models that can be directly applied to real-world degraded images
4. **Complementary strengths** - Each model excels in different aspects of restoration, providing an interesting comparison framework

## Problem Statement
Image degradation is a common challenge across photography, digital archives, and media. Issues include:
- Low resolution and loss of detail
- Noise and visual artifacts
- Blur and lack of sharpness
- Compression artifacts
- Color degradation

Traditional methods often struggle with these complex issues, especially when multiple degradation types co-exist in a single image. Modern AI approaches offer promising solutions for these challenging cases.

## Data Information
The project uses:
- **RealSRSet** - A benchmark dataset proposed in the BSRGAN paper (ICCV 2021) containing real-world low-quality images
- **Custom test dataset** - We're creating a structured collection of test images across several categories:
  - Portrait/facial images
  - Landscape and nature scenes
  - Urban/architectural photographs
  - Text documents
  - Images with fine textures and details
  - Low-light photography
  - Images with compression artifacts

This diverse dataset will enable systematic evaluation of each model's performance across different image types and degradation scenarios.

## Project Goals
